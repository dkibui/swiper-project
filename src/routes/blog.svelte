  <h1>Why you need a graphic designer</h1>
  <p>
    We have entered an era in marketing and advertising that puts greater value
    in graphic design services than ever before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, a lot of campaigns, especially those communicated digitally, are
    anchored on strong graphic design concepts. However, many businesses still
    fail to understand the nature of graphic design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below we highlight common misconceptions about graphic design that companies
    have, usually preventing them from making the most out of this service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many businesses resist the urge to hire a professional design artists unless
    they are implementing creative campaigns or major tasks, say, overhauling
    the company logo design, or perhaps opening new office locations. But
    graphic design is about conveying the company’s message in a visually
    appealing way. Graphic design therefore is something they will need even in
    accomplishing simple corporate communication tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Developing a website and printing a corporate brochure both require the
    input of a seasoned graphic designer regarding page readability, appeal and
    balance between the text and graphics, content and the blank spaces. Graphic
    designers are often misconstrued as an extension of the company’s hand. They
    are simply told to execute a design that’s already been conceptualized.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graphic designers should in fact be involved as early as the
    conceptualization stage. What is important is for marketing goals to be set,
    along with the company’s corporate communication guidelines that they can
    refer to. This way, the artist can contribute to the discussion about the
    viability of campaigns and come up with designs accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In most cases, they are used to collaborate with writers, photographers, and
    marketing experts in a professional setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a company is tries to slash their marketing costs they often forego the
    services of a professional designer. In truth, such talent and experience is
    not easily replaced by someone from communications team who happens to know
    “a little bit of Photoshop.” A seasoned designer can indeed help the company
    save on costs because such designers will usually have good industry
    connections with the cheapest quality providers, whether it is printers or
    photographers or just general suppliers of branding suppliers.
  </p>

  <p>
    A designer is trained to think of designs that not only catches the eye but
    also appeals to emotions through combining elements of design such as
    typography, colours and shapes.

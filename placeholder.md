COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS OF GRAPHIC DESIGN

We have entered an era in marketing and advertising that puts greater value in graphic design
services than ever before. Today, a lot of campaigns, especially those communicated digitally,
are anchored on strong graphic design concepts. However, many businesses still fail to
understand the nature of graphic design. Below we highlight common misconceptions about
graphic design that companies have, usually preventing them from making the most out of this
service.
Most businesses resist the urge to hire professional design artists unless they are implementing
creative campaigns or major tasks, say, overhauling the company logo design, or perhaps
opening new office locations. But graphic design is about conveying the company’s message in a
visually appealing way. Graphic design therefore is something they will need even in
accomplishing simple corporate communication tasks. Developing a website and printing a
corporate brochure both require the input of a seasoned graphic designer regarding page
readability, appeal and balance between the text and graphics, content and the blank spaces.
Graphic designers are often misconstrued as an extension of the company’s hand. They are
simply told to execute a design that’s already been conceptualized. Graphic designers should in
fact be involved as early as the conceptualization stage. What is important is for the marketing
goals to be set, along with the company’s corporate communication guidelines that they can refer
to. This way, the artists can contribute to the discussion about the viability of the campaign, and
come up with designs accordingly. In most cases, they are used to collaborate with writers,
photographers, and marketing experts in a professional setting.
When a company is tries to slash their marketing costs they often forego the services of a
professional designer. In truth, such talent and experience is not easily replaced by someone from
communications team who happens to know “a little bit of Photoshop.” A seasoned designer can
indeed help the company save on costs because such designers will usually have good industry
connections with the cheapest quality providers, whether it is printers or photographers or just
general suppliers of branding suppliers.
A designer is trained to think of designs that not only catches the eye but also appeals to
emotions through combining elements of design such as typography, colours and shapes. For
